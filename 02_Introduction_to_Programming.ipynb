    "# What is programming and what are algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a programmer is faced with very complex problems which are too complicated to be solved by hand or which would simply take too long. In such cases, programming helps to master these difficult tasks by delegating them to computers. A programmer creates a kind of \"recipe\" to solve a problem. This recipe is called **algorithm**. Basically, an algorithm can be understood as a step by step process which deals with the problem and finds an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numbers of ways to code an algorithm which solves a particular problem. Furthermore, an algorithm can be coded in different languages such as [__R__](https://www.r-project.org \"R-Project\"), [__C++__](http://www.cplusplus.com/info/ \"C++\") or [__Python__](https://www.python.org \"Python Software Foundation\"). However, the goal of this course is not to make the students become an expert in coding (since this is the strength of computer scientists). Economists, in turn, understand difficult problems and economic models and contribute in that way to the development of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**!¡!¡ This section needs to be improved in order to answer the question of why is it a good idea for people in Economics/Business/Social Sciences to learn programming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to create algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the calculation of the __factorial__ as a simple problem which can be solved with the help of an algorithm. It might seem too easy to give this task to a computer but it is the right exercise to start with for a beginner. The creation of an algorithm is divided into several interdependent steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the problem\n",
    "Although it seems to be obvious at first glance, it is crucial to fully comprehend the problem. An good example thereof is the [__Solow Growth Model__](http://www.pitt.edu/~mgahagan/Solow.htm \"Solow Growth Model\"). Without an understanding of the Solow Growth Model, even an excellent programmer will have troubles in creating an algorithm to solve it. Therefore, it is necessary to understand all the underlying aspects of a task before solving it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Hence, before tackling the factorial problem, it is necessary to understand its fundamental concept in more detail. For instance, the factorial of 5 looks as follows:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1= 120$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Mathematically, the factorial of a number is thus the product of all positive integers less than or equal to this number. Moreover, it needs to be considered that only positive integers are allowed and that the factorial of 0 is equal to 1.\n",
    "</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of understanding the problem is to see the algorithm as a __production function__ which takes some information from the outside world as input and creates in turn a certain output. It is even possible to incorporate one production function into another to create a bigger program. In computer science, this structure is known as the [__Divide and Conquer Principle__](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithms/Divide_and_Conquer \"Divide and Conquer Principle\"). Imagine a very complex issue. It is easier to tackle this task by breaking it down into smaller problems which can be solved independently.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Let us turn again to our factorial problem. The input from the outside world needs to be a positive integer. The output is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to this number. Furthermore, the calculation of the factorial can be divided into several sequent steps:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>A positive integer as an input by the user</li>\n",
    "<li>The definition of the integers which are multiplied</li>\n",
    "<li>The multiplication of all the integers</li>\n",

    "A problem can be solved in different ways. Often every approach provides some advantages. Therefore, a comparison of the different methods allows to find the most efficient and most convenient one. On top, more options allow also more flexibility which might be helpful later on during the programming process as soon as the programmer recognises that his first approach is not appropriate. Moreover, the development of the alternative solution is a good exercise to understand the task in more detail.<br>\n",
